SleepWhisper – Privacy Policy

Last updated: 23 November 2025

SleepWhisper (“the App”, “we”, “us”) is a mobile application that helps you track night noise and sleep activity. We respect your privacy and are committed to handling your data in a transparent and secure way.

By using SleepWhisper, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

1. Data we collect
1.1. Audio recordings and sound events

The App can record audio on your device in order to detect sound events (snoring, coughing, movement, etc.).

All audio data is processed and stored locally on your device.

We do not upload audio recordings or raw sound data to our servers.

You can delete recordings at any time from within the App or by removing the app from your device.

1.2. Usage data inside the app

The App may store locally:

Night start and end times

Duration of recording

Number and approximate time of detected sound events

Simple “night score” and statistics shown in the History screen

This information is stored only on your device and is used to show you your history and trends. We do not have access to it.

2. Advertising and third-party services
2.1. Google Mobile Ads (AdMob)

The free version of SleepWhisper shows ads using Google Mobile Ads (AdMob).
AdMob may collect certain information from your device to provide and improve advertising, such as:

Device identifiers (e.g. IDFA or similar)

Approximate location (based on IP address)

App usage information related to ad impressions and clicks

This data is processed according to Google’s privacy policy and is not stored or controlled by SleepWhisper.

You can learn more here:

Google Privacy Policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy

AdMob and how it uses data: https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543

If you purchase the Premium version (Remove Ads), banner/interstitial ads are removed from the App.

2.2. App Store and in-app purchases

Payments for in-app purchases (e.g. Premium upgrade) are processed by Apple App Store. We do not receive your full payment details (such as credit card numbers). Apple may collect and process personal data in accordance with its own privacy policy: https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/

3. How we use your information

We use the information described above to:

Detect and visualise sound events during the night

Calculate simple sleep activity metrics and scores

Display a history of nights and statistics to you

Show relevant advertising in the free version of the App

Maintain Premium status (for users who purchased it)

We do not sell your personal data to third parties.

4. Data storage and security

Audio recordings and sleep statistics are stored only on your device.

If you delete the App or recordings, this data is removed and cannot be recovered by us.

We do not operate our own cloud servers for user content in this version of the App.

Please note that no method of electronic storage is 100% secure, but we aim to minimise the amount of data processed and keep as much as possible on-device.

5. Children’s privacy

SleepWhisper is not designed for children under the age required by local law to consent to data processing without parental approval. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child is using the App and providing information, please contact us so we can help you delete any relevant data from the device.

6. Your choices

You can:

Control microphone access in iOS Settings → Privacy → Microphone.

Delete recordings and history directly in the App or by deleting the App.

Disable personalised ads in your device settings (Limit Ad Tracking / Allow Apps to Request to Track).

7. International users

The App may be used worldwide. Third-party partners such as Apple and Google may process data on servers located in various countries, in accordance with their own privacy policies.

8. Changes to this policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The latest version will always be available from within the App and on our website. Continued use of the App after changes are posted means you accept the updated policy.
