SleepWhisper — Privacy Policy

Last updated: 26 November 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use SleepWhisper: Night Recorder (the “App”).

If you have any questions about this Policy, you can contact us at:
Email: infew182@gmail.com


1. What SleepWhisper does

SleepWhisper is a mobile app that lets you record sounds during the night and review your sleep activity later. The App runs entirely on your device. We do not maintain our own servers that store your recordings or personal profile.

2. Data we process

We distinguish between data that is stored only on your device and data that is processed by Apple or other third parties when you use the App.

2.1 Audio recordings and sleep data (on-device)

Night recordings (audio files)

Detected sound segments (e.g. snoring, sleep-talk)

Basic statistics and history of your nights (dates, duration, number of events, etc.)

By default, all of this information is stored locally on your device.
If you use iCloud backup or device backup, Apple may copy this data as part of your normal device backup process. We do not control or access those backups.

We do not upload your audio recordings or night history to our own servers.

2.2 Subscription and purchase information

When you subscribe to SleepWhisper Premium (monthly or yearly), purchase and payment processing are handled by Apple via the App Store and your Apple ID.

We receive only limited information from Apple, for example:

an anonymous identifier that tells us whether you have an active Premium entitlement;

non-personal information about the country/region and product type (monthly / yearly), for internal analytics.

We do not see your full name, payment card details or full Apple ID e-mail.

2.3 Diagnostics and usage data

We may use Apple’s developer tools (for example, App Store Connect Analytics or Apple’s crash reporting) to understand how the App performs and to fix bugs. These tools may provide us with aggregated, anonymised information such as:

crashes and technical errors;

general usage patterns (for example, how often the App is opened).

This information does not include your audio recordings or detailed personal profile.

3. How we use the data

We use your data only for the following purposes:

Providing the main functionality

recording night sounds;

detecting sound events and building statistics;

showing your history of nights.

Handling Premium subscriptions

determining whether you currently have access to Premium features;

restoring purchases on a new device.

Improving the App and fixing bugs

analysing crashes and performance issues;

understanding which features are used most often.

We do not sell your data and do not use your night recordings for advertising.

4. Legal basis (for users in the EU/EEA & UK)

For users in the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, we rely on the following legal bases:

Performance of a contract – to provide the core functionality of the App and Premium features you choose to purchase.

Legitimate interests – to improve the App, maintain security and prevent fraud.

Consent – where required by local law (for example, for notifications).

5. Sharing of data

We only share your data in the following limited situations:

With Apple – for purchases, subscriptions, crash reports and backups, according to Apple’s own privacy policy.

Where required by law – if we are legally obliged to do so (for example, in response to a valid legal request).

We do not share your night recordings or statistics with advertising networks.

6. Data retention

Audio recordings and sleep statistics remain on your device until you delete them or uninstall the App.

Subscription-related information is kept for as long as necessary to provide Premium access and to comply with legal and accounting obligations.

Diagnostic data from Apple’s tools is retained according to Apple’s own retention policies.

If you delete the App from your device, locally stored data is deleted by iOS/iPadOS as part of the uninstall process. Data in your iCloud or device backups may remain there according to your backup settings.

7. Your rights

Depending on your location, you may have the right to:

access certain information about how we process your data;

request correction of inaccurate information;

request deletion of information that is no longer needed;

object to certain types of processing or withdraw consent (where applicable).

Because most data is stored only on your device, you can exercise many of these rights directly by:

deleting recordings and nights in the App;

turning off recording;

uninstalling the App.

8. Children

SleepWhisper is not designed for children under 4 years old. For younger users, the App should be installed and managed by a parent or legal guardian.

We do not knowingly collect personal data directly from children without parental consent.

9. Security

We rely on the security mechanisms of iOS / iPadOS to store data locally on your device. You can additionally protect your device with a passcode, Face ID or Touch ID.

No system is completely secure, but we take reasonable steps to protect your information from unauthorised access and loss.

10. Changes to this Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The latest version will always be available in the App and at the published URL. If changes are significant, we may show an in-app notice.
